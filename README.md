# AlgorithmDS-JS
A collection of JavaScript algorithms and data structures implementation. including sorting, searching, and various types of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and more. This repository is a useful resource for anyone looking to improve their understanding of these concepts in JavaScript."


1 - `bubble-sort.js`The first example is a sorting algorithm in JavaScript called bubble sort. It sorts an array in ascending order by repeatedly iterating through the array and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The function continues to iterate until the array is sorted.

2 - `linear-search.js` The second example is a search algorithm in JavaScript called linear search. It searches for a target value in an array by iterating through the array and comparing each element to the target. If the element is found, the function returns the index at which it was found. If the element is not found, the function returns -1. Linear search is a simple search algorithm, but it can be inefficient for large arrays because it has to check every element in the array.

3 - `depth-first-search.js` The third example is a graph algorithm in JavaScript called depth-first search. It searches through the nodes of a graph, starting at a specified start node. It uses a stack to keep track of the nodes that have been visited and adds the neighbors of the current node to the stack. The function continues until there are no more nodes in the stack.

4 - `linked-list.js` The fourth example is a linked list class in JavaScript. A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element is a separate object, linked to the previous and next elements. The class includes methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements, as well as reversing the linked list.

5 - `stack.js` The fifth example is a stack class in JavaScript. A stack is a data structure that follows the last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle. It has methods for pushing (adding) elements to the top of the stack, popping (removing) elements from the top of the stack, and accessing the top element without removing it. It also has methods for checking if the stack is empty, determining the number of elements in the stack, and clearing the stack.

6 - `queue.js` The sixth example is a queue class in JavaScript. A queue is a data structure that follows the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. It has methods for enqueuing (adding) elements to the end of the queue, dequeuing (removing) elements from the front of the queue, and accessing the front element without removing it. It also has methods for checking if the
